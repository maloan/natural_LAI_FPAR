# **Intermediate Processed Data**

This directory stores harmonized, analysis-ready inputs used throughout the LAI/FPAR workflow.
All files here are generated by earlier preprocessing steps and serve as stable dependencies for masking, aggregation, and evaluation.

## **Directory structure**

* **`frac/`**
  Fractional land-cover products at 0.05°, cropland and urban fractions derived from ESA-CCI or GLC sources.
  Used when constructing *used-land* masks and evaluating land-cover consistency.

* **`georef/`**
  Georeferenced LAI and FPAR monthly fields at 0.05° after reprojection, bounding-box correction, and alignment to the canonical grid.
  These files are the direct inputs to masking (`07_apply_mask_0p05.R`) and subsequent 0.25° aggregation.

## **Notes**

* All rasters in this folder follow the naming conventions defined in `R/names.R`.
* Resolution, CRS, and extent conform to the project’s reference grids defined in `config/config.yml`.
* Downstream scripts treat these files as immutable; regeneration occurs only by re-running the relevant preprocessing stages.
